Now we know that San Francisco has set up more bike stations this year. People are more likely to go west and south parts of the city. However, there are still half of the census tracts that have no bike stations. Even though bike ridership decline this year, with the goal of reducing carbon emission and promoting telecommuting, bikes are more welcome in the future transportation. As planners, we would like to see the bike stations distribution in the city. Which census tracts or street should have a new bike staton to meet the public needs? 

# Bike station to its street

bike station accessibility is one of the significant elements for ridership. Here is map showing the current street segments that have bike stations. We can see some bike station "desert" in the city. Establishing more stations in west,central and south are the priority for the transportation organization.

# Bike station heat map

Another map showing the hot spot for bike stations. It can help the government to determine which blocks or neighborhoods have the new station demand.
