The project will conduct a research of bikeshare data in Bay Area. The dataset will cover the past few years to the current year. This research will find out how COVID-19 affected bikeshare in Bay Area. In this project, l will compare pre-COVID data with Post-COVID data.The entire dataset will surpass 1,000,000 rows. The dataset includes start point, end point, duration, time, and start and end station. A few steps that l propose below:

• Download the dataset, merge these data and slice some outliers.

• Map out the start and end points. Find out the duration distribution of these points.

• Groupby station, find out which stations are more popular or less popular. A heat map or clustering analysis could help us to visualize these data.

• Map out these data based on the census tract in Bay area. Find out which census tract is more welcome?

• Do the same steps for Post-Covid. Is there any change between pre-Covid and postCovid? Do people change their destinations? How does Covid affect the ridership?

• What is the difference between each day, week or month? 

• Use Openstreetmap, Download data of commercial and resident places. Is there any relationship between bikeshare with these places? Post-Covid?

• A web visualization will be shown in the end.
